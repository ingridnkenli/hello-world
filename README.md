Introduction to Github for the first time

Hello World!
My name is Ingrid and I am a 19 year old student with a passion for writing, design, and code I'm a sophomore Information Systems major and have recently dug into web development. My strengths are HTML/CSS and some aspects of Javascript. My goal in 5 years is to have a prosperous career in web development and be able to use it to kickstart my other interests!
